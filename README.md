# Patient-Billing-Software-System
This  project  is  aimed  at  developing  a  patient  billing  software  system  that  is  of  importance  to  a  hospital.  The  PBS  is  a  local  software, software framework  system.  This  system  can  be  used  to  maintain the  location  (bed no.)  of  each  patient  either  in  the  ward  or  the  ICU.  Information  about  the  patient  and  the  charges  to  be  paid  is  also  stored.
